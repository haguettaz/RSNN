# Towards Associative Recall in a Recurrent Network of Spiking Neurons

*"Et tout d'un coup le souvenir m'est apparu."* - Marcel Proust, *Du côté de chez Swan*

## :boom: Spiking Neural Network

We consider a network of $L$ spiking neurons, each neuron receives $K$ input signals from the other neurons.
The $\ell$-th neuron has potential
\begin{equation}
    z_{\ell}(t) = \sum_{k=1}^K w_{\ell,k} y_{\ell, k} (t)
\end{equation}
with $y_{\ell, k} (t) \triangleq (h_{\ell, k} * x_{i_{\ell, k}})(t)$, and, a spike is produced whenever this potential is above some firing threshold $\theta(t) > 0$.
